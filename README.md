    <h1 align="center">Legodb : A low-code backend tool for every ship-fast project</h1>
</p>

Legodb is an open-source, simple, and flexible go-to backend solution for all your ship-fast projects. It seamlessly integrates with dashboards, drawing inspiration from the UX/UI of Notion's inline databases and Discord's server and channel system.

It allows you to easily structure your application database in a visual way with an intuitive UX. The dashboard and API are automatically generated based on your designed database structure.

 <h2>Motivation</h2>
</p>
I have had to develop different dashboards multiple times. Most of the time, the work involves CRUD operations for various datasets, which has made me quite bored with creating dashboards for different applications. So, I started looking for a CMS, but most of the existing options didn’t meet my needs. I want a simpler, more modern UX that supports drag-and-drop sorting and ordering, nested relationships, APIs, webhook subscriptions, and data entry dashboards with various permission levels and public access, all separated from the database. It should also be accessible to people with minimal technical knowledge. That’s why I decided to develop my own headless CMS, inspired by Notion’s inline databases and Discord-like UX.

 <h2>Roadmap</h2>
</p>
The very first concept of the LegoDb Demo MVP was developed, but due to skill issues, the performance is really bad. The UI/UX hasn't been properly addressed because it's just a demo MVP developed in a short amount of time. The current goal is to fix performance issues, resolve bugs, enhance the UI/UX, and refactor the codebase to make it more modular and reusable. You can view the roadmap and to-do list here.

As my skills improve, the quality, performance, and security of this project will continue to get better. This project will be a long-term endeavor for me, and I will focus on improving my skills while working on it during my free time.
